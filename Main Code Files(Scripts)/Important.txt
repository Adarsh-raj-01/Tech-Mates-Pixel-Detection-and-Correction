For the Detection Part, kindly change the dataset directory paths to the designated place where the directory is being downloaded from the drive. This change is to be only reflected in the code in order for the trained model to load those datasets.

For the Correction Part, kindly check where the result is being stored as inside the code, there is a specified place for storing the result. You may change the result directory path in code.
